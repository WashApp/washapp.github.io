<p><b>Is stain removal guaranteed?</b></p>

<p>We at WashApp don't believe stains to be good. Stains spoil the look and feel of your clothing. We are very positive about the success of our process in removing stains. But, stain removal also depends on the nature and location of the stain on your fabric. We believe that stain removal must not be attained at the cost of the quality of the fabric. So, we employ processes which don’t spoil the fabric and tries to remove the stain at the same time. The specific processes and success rate can be discussed with our service executive.</p>
